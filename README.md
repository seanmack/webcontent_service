This is a brand new project, so this README will be developing over time.

The overall goal here is to make a service to simplify managing and generating
content for a static website. For example, a build for an 11ty site running on
Netlify could call this API to retrieve content for static pages. The API could
provide user-generated content (once that UI is developed), as well as content
generated by OpenAI or similar.

This would make it easy to quickly generate a demo static site without having to
manually enter data.
